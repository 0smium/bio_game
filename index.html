      <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>I was born in Boston on March 22, 1985 as the first child of John and Linda.  I have few memories of my first home in Somerville, MA, a few miles north of Boston.  Just before my third birthday, we moved to Wakefield, MA, 10 miles north Boston.  I lived in that same home through age 22, except when away at college.</p>
